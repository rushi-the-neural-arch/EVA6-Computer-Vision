We have created a model which can predict handwritten digits has the ability to add them with random number as well.
The model is trained on Lenet architecture and then it is connected with another network which takes that input predicted by the Lenet model and another random number and adds them. 
we have used cross-entropy loss for the handwritten classification and rmse for addition network.We have trained the model for 5 epoch.
