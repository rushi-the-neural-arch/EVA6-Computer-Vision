## Code1 - Setup
**Target**

. Set up the skeleton with dropout, batch Norm etc

**Results** 

. Parameters - 8064 

. Best training accuracy- 98.13

. Best test accuracy - 99.17

**Analysis**

. Model is under-fitting

. The gap between test and train is high

. Capacity can be increased

## Code2
**Target**

. Added 1 more convolution layer and Gap Layer

. Changed the number of kernels in some conv layers

. Increased the capacity

**Results**

. Parameters - 9634

. Best training accuracy- 98.67

. Best test accuracy - 99.4


**Analysis**

. Target is reached, but only once.

. Model is still under-fitting


## Code 3

**Target**

. Increased the dropout from 0.1 to 0.12

**Results**

. Parameters - 9872

. Best training accuracy- 98.64

. Best test accuracy - 99.32

**Analysis**

. Model is still under-fitting

. The accuracy of both is reduced by increasing dropout

## Code 4

**Target**

. Decreased the dropout from 0.12 to 0.05

**Results**

. Parameters - 9872

. Best training accuracy- 98.91

. Best test accuracy - 99.53

**Analysis**

. Reached the desired accuracy at 8th epoch

. Should see how it works introducing LR and reducing no of parameters

## Code 5

**Target**

. Decreased the dropout from 0.05 to 0.02

**Results**

Parameters - 8016

Best training accuracy- 98.93

Best test accuracy - 99.42

**Analysis**

. Reached the desired accuracy at 11th epoch with less parameters
