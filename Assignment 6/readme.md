    Problem statement
    You are making 3 versions of your 5th assignment's best model (or pick one from best assignments):
        Network with Group Normalization
        Network with Layer Normalization
        Network with L1 + BN
    You MUST:
        Write a single model.py file that includes GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include
        Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 20 epochs each
        Create these graphs:
            Graph 1: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
            Graph 2: Test/Validation Accuracy for 3 models together
            graphs must have proper annotation
        Find 10 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images. 
        write an explanatory README file that explains:
            what is your code all about,
            how to perform the 3 covered normalization (cannot use values from the excel sheet shared)
            your findings for normalization techniques,
            add all your graphs
            your 3 collection-of-misclassified-images 
        Upload your complete assignment on GitHub and share the link on LMS
        Mention the name of your partners who are doing the assignment. If someone submits separately, then we will see who scored lowest, and we will assign the lowest to all. If there are NO partners, then mention there are NO parters and make sure NO one mentions your name.
